# FYPChatbot
## Project Overview
This is a Final Year Poject (FYP) from Aston University. The main concept of this chatbot is to proactively hold a conversation about their past life experiences. 
The user would pre-load images, videos and audio relating to the system past event they woud like to discuss with the the chatbot. 
Then, the chatbot would present those media types to the user and ask follow-up prompts to gain more information about that specific artifact. 
The bot was developed using the Botpress v12 framework. 

**IMPORTANT**: With the launch of Botpress Cloud, the documentation for Botpress v12 can now be found [here](https://v12.botpress.com/).
